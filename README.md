# Embedded Design Patterns

## [Callback Pattern](https://github.com/brackal/Embedded-Design-Patterns/tree/main/CallbackPattern)
The callback pattern is a classic observer pattern. An implementation of the observer pattern can be found at https://github.com/brackal/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Cpp.
The callback pattern is used in embedded software to implement a asynchronous communication between software elements. For example if the button press needs to be communicated asynchronously to the application.

## [MVC pattern in embedded monolithic system](https://github.com/brackal/Embedded-Design-Patterns/tree/main/MVC-in-embedded-monolithic-system)
In progress!
